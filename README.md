## Development Notes

### Recent Architecture Changes
- **Migrated from Vanilla JS/Bootstrap to React/Tailwind** for better maintainability
- **Preserved all original functionality** while improving code organization
- **Modern React patterns** with functional components and hooks
- **Type-safe development** with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces

### Build Configuration
- **Webpack 5** with optimized production builds
- **PostCSS** for Tailwind processing and autoprefixing
- **TypeScript compilation** with JSX support
- **Asset copying** for icons and manifest files

## Wishlist
- **Better Caching** make caching expire with dynamic detection
- **No API key use** figure out how to do summary without API keys
- [x]**get the summary right away** do not wait for user to click the button, just start fetching the summary
- **configurable key and model** make model selection and secrets managed by some other tooling instead of browser local storage
- **model and version selection** want to use other models?

## Contributing

The extension is designed to be easily extensible:
- Add new AI models by extending the `LLMRequest` interface
- Customize styling with Tailwind utility classes
